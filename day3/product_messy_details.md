So the smart shelf project has been going kind of okay, but there are still a bunch of issues. We’ve managed to set up sensors in around 60% of the stores we were planning for Phase 1, but some stores had delays because of shipment and vendor response. The IT team is saying the software integration is almost done but there are still some things left in the API side that might take a little more time, but it should not be a huge issue. The operations team is trying to figure out the training schedule for store associates but not everyone has been onboarded yet. We also had some bugs come up in the dashboard when trying to read the inventory signals, so engineering is fixing that. Once that’s resolved, we can hopefully get back on track, but right now we’re a bit behind schedule and might need a few more weeks. I’ll get more clarity next week."
