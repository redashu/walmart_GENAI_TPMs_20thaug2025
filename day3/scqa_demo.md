## messy update (Raw TPM notes)

```
The shelf sensors are mostly working fine but some stores are reporting battery drain issues, and also the mobile app team is behind schedule because of API bugs. Leadership is asking if we’ll still hit the Q4 pilot. We’re also short on testers for the integration phase

## TPM (Raw info)

```
Hey team, quick update on the Smart Shelf project — so the vendor for the hardware still hasn’t confirmed the shipping timeline, we might get it end of this month but not sure, and meanwhile our internal dev team is still working on the API integration but some blockers came up around authentication with the retailer’s system, we think it’s due to mismatched tokens but engineering is debugging. On operations side, training materials for store staff are only halfway done because design is waiting on final screenshots from the app, which might take another week. Also finance is asking for a revised cost estimate because hardware pricing increased slightly — not huge but needs approval. Overall, I’d say we’re still on track for pilot next quarter, but risks are adding up
